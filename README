README for hpcalc
hpcalc is free software and licensed by GNU GPL 3

If you want to change hpcalc, you may do it how you want to and in line with GNU GPL 3. Nevertheless, I would find it very nice if you'd send me your improved version
so I can study it and transfer it to the original hpcalc (keep in mind, you have to license your changes by gpl). Of course you don't have to send it me, but, as said, it's very
nice to do it. Thank you!

Please send bugs, issues, tips, tricks and improved versions to <der.messer@web.de>.

== Before compiling ==

make sure, that the headers of libgmp are installed on your system (e.g. libgmp-dev)

Some tips for compiling hpcalc:

The makefile compiles the source code efficiently into a single ELF file (architecture depending of the gcc version). There are some preprocessor constants
which you may change to customize the debug level, precision etc.

	-- in headers/math_hpcalc.h: ACC (for ACCuracy) defines the default accuracy for GMP in bits. Can be dynamically changed with the option '-b'.
	-- in headers/main.h: DEBUG controls if hpcalc prints more or less debug information. Of course you may insert your own debug routines.
	-- in headers/main.h: ERR_DATATYPE controls the error message if the user gives conflicting datatypes (e.g. hpcalc -i -f)
	-- in headers/main.h: ERR_CALCTYPE controls the error message if the user gives conflicting calculation types (e.g. hpcalc -i -a -s)
