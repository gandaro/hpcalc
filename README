README for hpcalc
hpcalc is free software and licensed by GNU GPL 3

If you want to change hpcalc, you may do it how you want to and in line with GNU GPL 3. Nevertheless, I would find it very nice if you'd send me your improved version
so I can study it and transfer it to the original hpcalc (keep in mind, you have to license your changes by gpl). Of course you don't have to send it me, but, as said, it's very
nice to do it. Thank you!

Please send bugs, issues, tips, tricks and improved versions to <der-messer@gmx.de>.

===== HELP FROM THE PROGRAM =====


hpcalc (hyper precision calc) v0.5beta (base functions work almost perfectly)
(c) 2011 by Der Messer. License: GNU-GPL 3
hpcalc is a program to calculate with extreme large numbers and extreme precise numbers
hpcalc uses a high precision for floatpoint calculation while the length of integer numbers is only limited by your RAM

Data types (one, either -i or -f, must be specified):
	-i	Integer numbers. They can be very, very large (a few million digits)
	-f	Float numbers. hpcalc uses in this version of hpcalc by default a precision of 8192 bits for this numbers. You may use both , and . as decimal point

Calculation options: (You can only call 1 calculation option at once, if you do not so, you'll get an error)
	-a	Addition
	-s	Subtraction
	-m	Multiplication
	-d	Division (Floor round when using integers (25 / 4 == 6))
	-c	Division, but with ceiling round ( 25 / 4 == 7 ) - only available for integers
	-r	remainder (also called "modulo") - only available for integers
	-p	Power
	-g	Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) - only available for integers

	-b	With argument -b you may set the at-least-precision higher than 8192 bits (ex.: hpcalc -f -b 31415 -a 3.4 5.645). It's only expedient when using floats.
		You recognize the necessity to increase the precision when there are many 0 at the end of the result or you recognize that there are too few digits


Example: to get the solution of 3.4 + 5.4, type
	hpcalc -f -a 3.4 5.4

2nd Example: to get the solution of 24 ^ 12, type
	hpcalc -i -p 24 12

(If you calculate with integers, it's faster and sometimes more precise)
